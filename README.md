# History of Lisp Parentheses

A historical look at the many attempts to improve Lisp's most notorious
artifactâ€”_parentheses_.

I'd like to find out how people tolerated parens back in the golden days of
Lisp. I have a feeling we might've forgotten some things that would be useful
today, or might influence some new ideas.

Roughly, we cover the history in three parts:

1. [Editors](editors.md)
2. [Alternative Syntaxes](alt-syntax.md)
3. [Visual Decorations](decorations.md)
